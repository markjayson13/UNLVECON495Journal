# How to Submit

Follow these steps to add your paper to the journal:

1. **Prepare files**
   - Final PDF of the paper.
   - Front matter details: title, authors, abstract (150–300 words), keywords, publication date, and issue ID (e.g., `2025-fall`).
2. **Provide metadata**
   - Supply accurate author names as they should appear in citations.
   - Include keywords and a concise abstract to aid search and indexing.
3. **Share with the editorial contact**
   - Email **econ-journal@example.edu** with your PDF and metadata.
4. **Review and publish**
   - The editorial team will add the paper to the appropriate issue directory and verify formatting.

See the automation helpers in the README for creating new issue and paper files with the correct structure.
