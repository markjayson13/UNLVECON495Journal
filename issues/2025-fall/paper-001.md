abstract: |
  This study reviews post-pandemic housing market dynamics in Las Vegas, combining MLS listing trends with Census microdata. We examine price-to-income ratios, rental vacancy changes, and inventory churn to assess affordability pressure on first-time buyers. A difference-in-differences specification compares Las Vegas to peer metros, highlighting how supply constraints and remote-work inflows altered price resilience.
