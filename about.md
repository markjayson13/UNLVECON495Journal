        <h3>Mark Jayson Farol</h3>
        <p>Mark Jayson Farol earned both his Master’s in Quantitative Business Economics and his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (Economics) from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Originally from a rural community in the Philippines, he served as a graduate assistant and research collaborator with Professor Djeto Assané in UNLV’s Department of Economics, mentoring undergraduates on empirical research projects.</p>
        <p>His work focuses on higher education finance and access, including published research in this area. He approaches economics and the arts as complementary crafts: economics strengthens logic and principle, while art sharpens curiosity and attention to humanity. These perspectives shape his research, teaching, and creative work. He plans to pursue a doctoral degree in economics to deepen his research and expand his contributions at the intersection of scholarship and storytelling.</p>

      <h2>About ECON 495 (Seminar in Economic Research)</h2>
      <p>ECON 495 is the Economics program’s capstone course. The course strengthens students’ ability to do applied economic research by practicing core econometric tools, building models with real data, and communicating results clearly. Students complete a portfolio that typically includes a résumé/CV, applied projects, and an independent empirical term paper developed with instructor approval, plus a presentation of findings.</p>
