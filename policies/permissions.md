# Permissions and licensing

- Authors retain copyright to their work.
- By submitting, authors grant the proceedings a non-exclusive license to host, display, and archive the PDF and metadata.
- Authors may choose a permissive license (e.g., CC BY) or “all rights reserved.” Clearly state the choice in the paper if different from the default.
- Every submission must include a signed author permission form (see `templates/author-permission-form.md` in the repository) or equivalent documented consent from all authors and advisors.
