# Privacy guidance

- Do not include confidential or personally identifiable information (e.g., student IDs, phone numbers, addresses, grades).
- Use de-identified datasets whenever possible and follow data-use agreements.
- Remove sensitive appendices from public PDFs; include contact information only if authors explicitly consent.
- If private data is discovered after publication, request a correction or takedown.
