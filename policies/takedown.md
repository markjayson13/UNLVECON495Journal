# Takedown and corrections

To request a correction or takedown, email the course coordinator with:

- Paper ID (issue + paper number)
- URL to the paper page
- Reason for the request (e.g., factual correction, copyright, privacy)

We will review promptly, document the outcome on the paper page when appropriate, and remove or replace files if required.
